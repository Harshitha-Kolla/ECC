Elliptic Curve Cryptography: 
This project uses the properties of Elliptic Curves to provide an algorithm for the secure encryption and decryption of 128-bit data. Elliptic Curves have a property that the result of adding any 2 points on the curve lies on the curve. This helps us generate a unique secret key using 2 other keys: the public key and the private key.
Here, the generated secret key is applied to the Advanced Encryption Standard(AES) algorithm.
